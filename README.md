## About
Commandler's a command handling framework for Java. It's purpose is to try keep as much
of the reusable code as possible into a core project which can be the heart of any chatbot.  
You'll be able to get started quickly making clean, reliable, and reusable code 
with the framework which will help manage dependency injection, validation, and even generate
a website with all relevent documentation you define!

### Why use Commandler?
Commandler makes it a lot easier to get started making anything that requires command
handling, namely chat bots. It's designed not to be too bloaty or take command away from you
while putting together a stack of libraries and flow to work with.

* The modules and metaCommands you write are portable, so long as they aren't tied down to any
API specific functionality you can just plop them over to another project, or register another
`Controller` and see the command port over to another service.
* Commandler is under the hood is using familiar APIs such as Hibernate Validation,
and Google Guice, which should massively reduce learning.
* Using `Commandlerdoc` you can export your entire application as it's own website which
for a better experience for your users to read.
